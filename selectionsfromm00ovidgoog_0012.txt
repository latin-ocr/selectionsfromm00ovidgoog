Ira the series ol elementary works published by the editor
l of'the present volume, on the basis os Andrews and Stoddard's
Latin Grammar, the following Selections srorn the poema ol
ovid are intended as an Introduction to Latin Poetry.
Experienced tenchers have ollen regrelted the custom, so
prevalent in the schools ol thia country, of passing abruptly
from the easier prose writers toa work so diffieah, in many
respects, as the AEneid ol Virgil-a work requiring, sor its
profitable perusal, so intimate a knowledge of the mythology
and sabulous history os the Greeks, and of the peculiarities ol
poetic diction. In preparing this volume, the editor has enÎ‡
deavored to remedy, sofar as was in his power, the evils arising
hom this custom, by iurnishing a First Book in Latin Poetry
more simple in its style, and accompanied with such helpe as
might serve to render the transition from prose to poetry more
easy, and consequentiy more agreeable. For such a purpose,
the better portioris ol the writings os Ovid are peculiarly well
adopted, and to this use they have long been applied in the
classical sohouls os Europe. While the versification ol this
author is in no ordinary degree harmonicus, his language is
'simpla and his arrangement easy and natural. His subject,
also, in the works from which the following extracta are taken,
is well fitted sor an introduction to the study of Latin poetry,
inasrnuch as the mythological sables ol the Greeks are as
inseparably interwoven with the Latin, ns with the Grecian

poetry.
